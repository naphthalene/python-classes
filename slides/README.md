# Lesson Slides!

What's this, another `README`??

This folder will contain all of the slides. The content of the slides is
in Markdown format, the same as this README file. [Check out this
website for an overview of
Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Usage

When you run this command, it'll continuously scan the `src` folder for
changes, and output the slide deck into `dist`.

Make sure to run these commands from the `slides` folder, where this
`README` resides.

```
npm run serve
```

The website will be available on http://localhost:8080 until you press
Ctrl-C in the terminal.
